Welcome to REALLY BAD POKEMON, where all the pokemon will have
moves that they probably can't learn at all in the original games.

TODO (just in case I left anything out in the individual files):
Implement accuracy and evasion
Implement random move generator
Implement critical hits
Implement status conditions
Moves not implemented:

Bide
Bind
Clamp

Implement items
Implement 6-pokemon battles
Implement battle menu system (for switching pokemon, using items, etc)
