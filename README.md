This is an implementation inspired by Pokemon to practice on some coding skills.
This will most likely turn into a mini Pokemon Stadium (where the two Pokemon battle each other).

TODO (just in case I left anything out in the individual files):
Implement accuracy and evasion
Implement critical hits
Implement status conditions
Moves not implemented:

Bide
Bind
Clamp

Implement items
Implement 6-pokemon battles
Implement menu system (for switching pokemon, using items, etc)
